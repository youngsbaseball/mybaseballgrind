## 🌐 Where Things Live

| Surface | URL | Hosting | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-launch waitlist landing | https://mygrindapp.com | Vercel | `index.html` |
| Parent signup flow (8 screens) | https://mygrindapp.com/signup.html | Vercel | `signup.html` |
| Player onboarding | https://mygrindapp.com/onboarding.html | Vercel | `onboarding.html` |
| The journal app (live for beta) | https://mygrindapp.com/softball.html | Vercel | `softball.html` |
| Legacy app URL (still referenced inside `softball.html`) | https://youngsbaseball.github.io/mybaseballgrind/ | GitHub Pages | served via `mg-config.js` runtime override |
| SMS backend | `/api/send-invite` | Vercel serverless | `api/send-invite.js` |
| Static legal | mygrindapp.com/privacy.html, /terms.html | Vercel | `privacy.html`, `terms.html` |

- **Repo**: https://github.com/youngsbaseball/mybaseballgrind
- **Domain (live)**: mygrindapp.com (Vercel) — apex redirects to www
- **Cloud backend**: Firebase (`my-grind-b8486`) — Spark plan (free) — used for cloud sync of profile/entries/goals from `softball.html`
- **Mailchimp waitlist**: audience `73280b4c02e9bc56c7e633892`, tag `2216797` (subscribe form on `index.html` posts via JSONP to us8.list-manage.com)
- **Tech**: Hand-authored HTML files (CSS + vanilla JS inlined, no build step, no framework), Vercel serverless backend (Node ≥18, ESM), Redis-backed rate limiter

## 🛠️ Tech Decisions

- **No build step** — edits land directly. Pro: zero infra. Con: no linting, no automatic tests.
- **Single-file SPAs by design** — each HTML file is self-contained. State passes between files via `localStorage` and URL query params (`?name=Sofia&fallback=1`).
- **Service worker cache version** in `softball.html` — bump `ybg-mygrind-vN` every time you ship a meaningful update so users get fresh content.
- **`localStorage` is source of truth client-side** in `softball.html` (no auth/session backend yet for the journal app itself; signup flow's `api/send-invite.js` is the only serverless function so far).

## 🧱 Phase Status (Notion is authoritative — see "MyGrind Worldwide Launch HQ")

- **Phase 2 — Parent Signup Flow** — front-end complete (8 screens in `signup.html`). No backend wiring yet.
- **Phase 3a (Skeleton + Auth)** — COMPLETE
- **Phase 3b (Twilio SDK + Live Send)** — code complete, BLOCKED on toll-free verification pending
- **Phase 3c (Rate Limiting)** — COMPLETE + VERIFIED (Redis-backed, hashed IP/phone, fail-open)
- **Phase 3d (Twilio Lookup pre-check)** — COMPLETE (2026-05-02). `lib/lookup.js` runs Twilio Lookup v2 between E.164 normalization and rate-limit checks; rejects landlines, VoIP, and invalid numbers with friendly messages before any send budget is burned. Fail-open on Lookup outage.
- **Phase 4 — Player Onboarding** — `onboarding.html` shipped (per Decision #13: stripped of Stripe/Mailchimp/Firebase, just localStorage)
- **Phase 5 — Stripe wiring** — pending; pricing UI shipped, real checkout not wired
- **Phase 6 — Share + Settings buttons on signup dashboard** — COMPLETE (2026-05-02). Real modals replace the placeholder alerts. Share modal has copy-link + Web Share API + pre-written caption. Settings modal shows read-only account summary (name, email, phone, plan, players) + a support-email link for changes (self-serve editing lands when Phase 5 backend account management ships).
- **Phase 7 — Player dashboard** — pending; onboarding S14 currently shows a holding-screen overlay
- **Business Plan** — 14/14 sections COMPLETE
- **16 Locked Decisions** — source of truth in Notion

## 🐛 Known Issues / Followups

*Add discovered bugs to `docs/ROADMAP.md`. This list is for STABLE issues we've decided to defer.*

- ⚠️ **Two-host situation** — `mygrindapp.com` is the primary, `youngsbaseball.github.io/mybaseballgrind/` is legacy. `softball.html` still has hardcoded github.io URLs that `mg-config.js` overrides at runtime. When changing URLs, grep both.
- ⚠️ "Hover" issue on Daily Journal top dropdown reported — needs clarification (no specifics yet)
- ⚠️ Softball image showing where a baseball should — needs screenshot to identify
- ⚠️ Duplicate `escapeHtml()` function in `signup.html` (defined at lines 3264 + 3417) — second wins, both nearly identical. Maintenance trap.
- ⚠️ SMS preview in `signup.html` (line ~3344) shows `mygrind.app/start/abc123` — fake URL with placeholder token. Real Twilio send (when 3b unblocks) will generate a different link, but the preview is misleading to parents.
<!-- Share + Settings buttons fixed 2026-05-02 (Phase 6 shipped) — alerts replaced with real modals. -->

## 📈 Metrics to Track (when you're ready)

- Number of waitlist signups (Mailchimp dashboard, audience `73280b4c02e9bc56c7e633892`)
- UTM source breakdown (which channel converted best)
- Number of active app users (Firebase Auth dashboard)
- Number of daily journal entries created (Firestore queries)
- Backup adoption % (count of `ybg_last_backup` keys via cloud-sync if/when we wire that)
- Trial → paid conversion rate (Stripe dashboard)

No analytics service is wired up yet. Add Plausible or Posthog when you have time.
